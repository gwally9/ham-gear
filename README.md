`Equipment Tracker Web Application`

I've created a complete web frontend for your equipment tracker using Flask! Here's what I've built:

### Features
### Modern Web Interface:
- Clean, responsive design using Bootstrap 5
- Mobile-friendly layout
- Professional dashboard with statistics cards
### Core Functionality:
- Dashboard: Overview with total items, costs, and profit/loss calculations
- Add Equipment: User-friendly form with validation
- Edit Equipment: Modify existing entries
- Search: Find equipment by description, condition, or location
- Delete: Remove equipment with confirmation
### Visual Enhancements:
- Color-coded condition badges (Excellent=Green, Good=Blue, Fair=Yellow, Poor=Red)
- Profit/loss indicators with appropriate colors
- Font Awesome icons throughout
- Bootstrap alerts for user feedback
### Setup Instructions
- Install Flask:
`pip3 install flask`
- Run: `python3 equipment.py`
- Open your browser to: `http://localhost:5000`
### File Structure
The application will automatically create:
- equipment.py - Main Flask application
- templates/ directory with HTML templates
- equipment_data.json - Data storage file
### Key Improvements Over CLI Version
- Better User Experience: Point-and-click interface vs command line
- Visual Analytics: Dashboard with summary statistics
- Responsive Design: Works on desktop, tablet, and mobile
- Input Validation: Form validation with helpful error messages
- Search Functionality: Enhanced search across multiple fields
- Professional Look: Modern UI with consistent styling

# `Equipment Purchase Tracker`
 
I've created a comprehensive Python application for tracking equipment purchases. Here's what it includes:

### Key Features:
- Add Equipment: Store description, cost, purchase date, current retail/resale prices, location, and condition
- View All: Display all equipment in a formatted table
- Search: Find equipment by description
- Update: Modify existing equipment records
- Delete: Remove equipment entries
- Summary: Show totals and profit/loss calculations
### Data Storage:
- Uses JSON file (equipment_data.json) for simple, portable storage
- Automatically saves changes
- Includes timestamps for when items were added/updated
### How to Use:
- Save the code as equipment_tracker.py
- Run with python equipment_tracker.py
- Use the menu system to manage your equipment
### Data Fields Tracked:
- Item description
- Purchase cost
- Purchase date
- Current retail price
- Current resale price
- Resale location
- Condition (Good/Fair/Poor/Excellent)

The app handles input validation, provides a clean interface, and calculates useful summaries like total investment and potential profit/loss. The data is stored in a human-readable JSON format that you can also edit manually if needed.

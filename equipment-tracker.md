need a simple python app to store data regarding equiptment purchases that has item description, cost, date of purchase, current retail, current resale price, resale location, condition

Edit
I'll create a simple Python application for tracking equipment purchases. This will use a basic file-based storage system that's easy to set up and use.


Equipment Purchase Tracker
Code 
I've created a comprehensive Python application for tracking equipment purchases. Here's what it includes:

Key Features:

Add Equipment: Store description, cost, purchase date, current retail/resale prices, location, and condition
View All: Display all equipment in a formatted table
Search: Find equipment by description
Update: Modify existing equipment records
Delete: Remove equipment entries
Summary: Show totals and profit/loss calculations
Data Storage:

Uses JSON file (equipment_data.json) for simple, portable storage
Automatically saves changes
Includes timestamps for when items were added/updated
How to Use:

Save the code as equipment_tracker.py
Run with python equipment_tracker.py
Use the menu system to manage your equipment
Data Fields Tracked:

Item description
Purchase cost
Purchase date
Current retail price
Current resale price
Resale location
Condition (Good/Fair/Poor/Excellent)
The app handles input validation, provides a clean interface, and calculates useful summaries like total investment and potential profit/loss. The data is stored in a human-readable JSON format that you can also edit manually if needed.

Would you like me to add any additional features, such as export to CSV, categories for equipment types, or depreciation calculations?




add a web front-end to it

Edit
I'll create a web frontend for your equipment tracker using Flask. This will provide a clean, modern interface that's easy to use.


Equipment Tracker Web Application
Code ∙ Version 2 
I've created a complete web frontend for your equipment tracker using Flask! Here's what I've built:

Features
Modern Web Interface:

Clean, responsive design using Bootstrap 5
Mobile-friendly layout
Professional dashboard with statistics cards
Core Functionality:

Dashboard: Overview with total items, costs, and profit/loss calculations
Add Equipment: User-friendly form with validation
Edit Equipment: Modify existing entries
Search: Find equipment by description, condition, or location
Delete: Remove equipment with confirmation
Visual Enhancements:

Color-coded condition badges (Excellent=Green, Good=Blue, Fair=Yellow, Poor=Red)
Profit/loss indicators with appropriate colors
Font Awesome icons throughout
Bootstrap alerts for user feedback
Setup Instructions
Install Flask:
bash
pip install flask
Save and Run:
Save the code as app.py
Run: python app.py
Open your browser to: http://localhost:5000
File Structure
The application will automatically create:

app.py - Main Flask application
templates/ directory with HTML templates
equipment_data.json - Data storage file
Key Improvements Over CLI Version
Better User Experience: Point-and-click interface vs command line
Visual Analytics: Dashboard with summary statistics
Responsive Design: Works on desktop, tablet, and mobile
Input Validation: Form validation with helpful error messages
Search Functionality: Enhanced search across multiple fields
Professional Look: Modern UI with consistent styling
The web version maintains all the data from your original CLI application - it uses the same JSON storage format, so you can switch between both interfaces if needed!

when i select "Add first equipment" errors: "jinja2.exceptions.UndefinedError: 'moment' is undefined"

Edit
I see the issue! There's a Jinja2 template error where I tried to use a moment() function that doesn't exist. Let me fix that by updating the add template to properly set today's date.


Equipment Purchase Tracker
Code ∙ Version 3 
Perfect! I've fixed the error. The issue was that I was trying to use a moment() function that doesn't exist in the Jinja2 template.

Now the date field will be set to today's date using JavaScript instead, which you can see in the script section at the bottom of the add template. This approach is more reliable and doesn't require any additional dependencies.

The application should now work correctly when you click "Add first equipment". The purchase date field will automatically be set to today's date when the page loads, and you can change it if needed.

Try running the application again - the error should be resolved!
